# Kanji Stroke Study

WORK IN PROGRESS

A lot of people wonder which Chinese character has the most strokes. When I 
wondered that, and put the question to Google (and I didn't even have to type 
the whole question), I got a webpage listing a 64-stroke character pronounced 
"zh&eacute;" meaning "noisy" and using a component that also occurs in the 
character '&#x807E;', meaning "deaf." The character for "deaf" only has 22 
strokes.

It took me a lot of effort on Jim Breen's WWWJDIC to identify '&#x807E;' as 
U+807E in Unicode. As for the character for "noisy," I wonder if it's even 
present in Unicode. The page has it as an image file, not as a character that 
can be copied and pasted to a plain text file.

The page also listed FINISH WRITING

I don't intend to open this project to Hacktoberfest.
